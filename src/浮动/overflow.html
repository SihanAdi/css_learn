  <p>What does FFFF mean? FFFF is a vulgar slang acronym that refers to the misogynist motto, “find 'em, feel 'em, fuck 'em, and forget 'em.” The 'em in this case? You guessed it: women-in-general. There are variations on FFFF, including the total number of Fs and what specifically they stand for (e.g., fool, feed, etc).</p>
